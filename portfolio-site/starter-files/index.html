        <p>Ana Schwartz is a Chamorro-American artist residing in the Bay Area. This allowed her to be exposed to all sorts of media and diversity. As you look through her portfolio, you’ll notice some recurring themes: creepy, cute, and whimsical. This also applies to the artist's name she calls herself Comagirl. Her art is an experience between dreaming and reality–stuck, almost like a coma. Although morbid, this suits her artistic vision considering her dream-like and weird pieces.</p>

       
        
        <p> Growing up, She’s always been a creative child. She was drawn to cartoons, movies, comics, video games, and all sorts of media. The weirder the better. This would encourage her to embrace femininity, horror, and her own self-expression. Her passion for digital illustration, 3D modeling, and video editing allows her to create mixed media, and surrealist pieces that push the limitations of possibility.</p>
